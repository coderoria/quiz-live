# Quiz ðŸ”´ Live
## A live quiz system originally created for [![Twitch Status](https://img.shields.io/twitch/status/xlandaro?label=xLandaro&style=flat)](https://twitch.tv/xlandaro)
## Question Catalogues
Create question Catalogues for every contestant or game with unlimited questions inside of it.

## Questions
Every question can have four possible answers (A,B,C,D). Select the right one before saving and you're good to go.

## Live Overlays
Quiz Live currently provides a single browser source for embedding the current question and possible answers inside of your favourite streaming software.
If the contestant decides on an answer, the moderator (streamer, admin,...) can set the answer and show the correct one on demand.
These two stages are indicated on the overlay by two colors (orange, green).
